<!-- badges: end -->

The R package QDRS provides functions for calculating quantitative disease risk scores, with application to Eletronic Health Records.

## Installation

You can install the *development* version of QDRS from Github:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("danqingxu/QDRS")
```

## Usage

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(QDRS)

# EHR demo data
# sample.set: matrix of binary features.
# sample.group: a grouping factor with two levels "Case" and "Control". 
# training: an index vector that indicates training rows.
sample.set = EHR$sample.set
sample.group = EHR$sample.group
training = EHR$training

PheRS.res = PheRS(X = sample.set, group = sample.group)
Eigen.res = eigen.score(X = sample.set, training = training)
PC.res = PC(X = sample.set, group = sample.group, training = training, pc.num = 1:2)
LPC.res = LPC(X = sample.set, group = sample.group, training = training)
LVS.res = LVS.score(X = sample.set)
NMF1.res = NMF1(X = sample.set)
```
